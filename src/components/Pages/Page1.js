                I would call and you would say
                Baby how's your day
                But today, it ain't the same
                Every other word
                Is "uh-huh" yeah "okay"
                Could it be that you

                First of all, let me say
                I am not the one
                To sit around, and be played
                So prove yourself to me
                I am the girl that you claim
                Why don't you say the thangs
                That you said to me yesterday
                I know you say that I am assuming things
                Something's going down that's the way it seems
                Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
                If nobody's holding you back from me
                'Cause I know how you usually do
                When you say everything to me times two
                Why can't you just tell the truth
                If somebody's there then tell me who
                Say my name, say my name
                If no one is around you
                Say baby I love you
